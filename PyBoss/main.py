Python Homework PyPoll
Due: 2 December 2019

Your company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for you, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.

Your task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format. Your script will need to do the following:

Import the employee_data.csv file, which currently holds employee records like the below:
-Emp ID,Name,DOB,SSN,State
-214,Sarah Simpson,1985-12-04,282-01-8166,Florida
-15,Samantha Lara,1993-09-08,848-80-7526,Colorado
-411,Stacy Charles,1957-12-20,658-75-8526,Pennsylvania

Then convert and export the data to use the following format instead:
-Emp ID,First Name,Last Name,DOB,SSN,State
-214,Sarah,Simpson,12/04/1985,***-**-8166,FL
-15,Samantha,Lara,09/08/1993,***-**-7526,CO
-411,Stacy,Charles,12/20/1957,***-**-8526,PA

In summary, the required conversions are as follows:
-The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.
-The DOB data should be re-written into MM/DD/YYYY format.
-The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
-The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.
